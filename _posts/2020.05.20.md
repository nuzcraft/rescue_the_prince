## Starting to Move and Collide
Heyo, I pulled some code from one of my old gamemaker projects to try to get a handle on platformer movement and collisions. This is a decent start, but there's still some work to do, specifically with horizontal collisions. As it is, the code needs a small refactor, I need to add in collision masks, and I want to start laying the foundation of unit tests. It will be a miracle if I happen to put aside the time for it, but that's just how its going right now...I'd rather play Monster Hunter :D
