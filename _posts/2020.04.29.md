## Getting Started

Welp, I tried to use github pages, but quit that pretty quick. I didn't want to spend so much time trying to get it set up, so I'm just going to use the readme how I feel like using it.

I've done _a little_ work in JS, mostly when writing *There are SLIMES in this DUNGEON* for the 2020 7DRL game jam. I'm beginning this project by trying to learn a little bit more about JS.

I'm currently using my company's trial period of Percipio from Skillsoft to take some JS courses.
