## index.html

I took a stab at getting this project going with the main html file. There isn't much there, and most of the logic is based on *There are SLIMES in this DUNGEON* which itself is based on @humbit's Broughlike tutorial. It's really basic, but starts the path of rendering our princess and some sort of floor. 

I need to spend some time designing a mockup for this in Aseprite, but maybe that should wait until after I've got some of the basic mechanics built out.
