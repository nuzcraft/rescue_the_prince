## Adding more Princess Sprites

Well, I decided that the princess needed a couple more sprites to indicate what they were doing. Namely, they needed a jumping and falling sprite, which I (poorly) created and (poorly) implemented. I've created an issue to revamp how we use sprites to make it a bit more similar to the way other tools do, where the image for the sprite is defined as multiple frames of an animation, then the frames are swapped at a certain rate for the animation. I'd also like to solve the mystery of easily flipping the sprite so I don't have to have duplicate sprites flipped back and forth.
