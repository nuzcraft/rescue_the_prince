## fonts and objects and animation

Woo! I felt like I had a good day with this, even though I only spent maybe an hour and a half on it. Firstly, I went looking for a better font and messed about with that for a while. I didn't really find what I was looking for, but instead added some functionality to my drawText function so I can add bold, italics, etc pretty easily.

I created the solid class, which will be used to hold solid objects (like the ground, maybe platforms in some cases). Currently, there's only a stone block

I created the Entity class, which will be used to hold entities, namely things that move about. Some will be affected by gravity, but this should handle most of them. Finally, I added some animation to entities. Most of the creatures will have a second frame, and this will let me use it easily.

Next on my list is to implement gravity and code our first real collision...the player with the ground.
