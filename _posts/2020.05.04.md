## Spritesheets instead

This was a fun little exercise, as I moved from using an individual png for each sprite to using a sprite sheet. I created a small little sprite class with a draw method that takes some of the complexity out when I'm ready to call these - it should be easy to draw a sprite based on the x and y position of the object.
