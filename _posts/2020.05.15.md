## 10 DAYS
It's been 10 days since I've done any proper work on this, mostly because I've only worked on it when I _should_ be working on other things.. :)

Regardless, I've hit some milestones in that time, adding in a semblence of gravity and vertical collision of entities with solids. I'm not convinced that my current model of solids or entities is 'good' mostly because their dimensions are directly connected to their sprites. What I should probably do is assign them their own collision masks that can default to sprite width and height, but can be overwritten. Theres a button for jumping, and it works too!
